user's query. It first converts the database into a retriever, which is a tool that searches for the
nearest embeddings in the vector space. It then sets various parameters for the search, such as the metric
to use when measuring distance in the embedding space, the number of documents to fetch initially,
whether or not to use maximal marginal relevance to balance the diversity and relevance of the results,
and how many results to return. The retrieved results are then passed through the language model,
which is GPT-3.5 Turbo in this case, to generate the most appropriate response to the user's query."""

"""Streamlit

Streamlit is a Python framework used for building data visualization web applications.
 It provides an intuitive way to create
interactive web apps for machine learning and data science projects.

Now we have the part with the conversation history between the user and the chatbot using Streamlit's
messaging functionality. It goes through the previous messages in the conversation and displays each user
message followed by the corresponding chatbot response.
It employs the Eleven Labs API to convert the chatbot's text response into speech and give the chatbot
a voice. This voice output, in MP3 format, is then played on the Streamlit interface, adding an auditory
dimension to the conversation:"""
