dynamic prompts: Instead of using a static template, this approach incorporates examples of previous
interactions, allowing the AI better to understand the context and style of the desired response.

Dynamic prompts offer several advantages over static templates:
Improved context understanding: By providing examples, the AI can grasp the context and style of responses
more effectively, enabling it to generate responses that are more in line with the desired output.

Flexibility: Dynamic prompts can be easily customized and adapted to specific use cases, allowing developers
to experiment with different prompt structures and find the most effective format for their application.

Better results: As a result of the improved context understanding and flexibility,
dynamic prompts often yield higher-quality outputs that better match user expectations.
